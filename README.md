AIT Task Board
==============

The AIT Task Board offers optimized visualization of the Team Foundation Server 2010 Work Items and their relations. 
It can be used independently of the applied process template and utilizes the link types introduced in the Team Foundation Server 2010. 
It is therefore possible to use the task board as the SCRUM Board or KANBAN Board.
